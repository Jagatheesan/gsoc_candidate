==============

The list of candidates for the Google summer of code civicrm project is visible in the page civicrm/gsoc

If you are a candidate, can you install civicrm, add this extension and visit the page civicrm/gsoc

Notice that we don't see your name yet. This need to be fixed, and your mission is to fix it, using our workflow with git (clone this repository, commit your change and make a pull request)

The point is not to show us that you know everything about civi, but that you can manage the publication process.
